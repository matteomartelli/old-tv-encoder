old-tv-encoder
==============

This script allows you to convert your videos in a readble format for the digital terrestrial television decoders used in old TV (the script changes the resolution and the codec). The scripts also allow you to optionally add subtitles (encoded in the video) in a very comfortable way.
The scripts uses zenity and mencoder.

Tested on Linux Mint 13, Mate edition.
